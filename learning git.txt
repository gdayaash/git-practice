We are using Github to track the code and Manage versions of the code, which is a program.

The Github Remote URL is Called as Origin which is the main of the remote repository.

To clone the remote repository in local: git clone https://github.com/gdayaash/git-practice.git
                                                                   |
                                                                   V
                                                          URL of the repository

Basic Steps to Add an file or piece of code after every change or creation.

Insert > Add > Commit > Push

1. First check the Git Status : git status 

-> It will show the branch we are currently operating and also the status of the Files whether it Tracked or Untracked.

2. Second add the Changes to queue (Staging Area): git add test1.txt
                                                              |
                                                              V
                                                           File Name  

-> It will track the changes done and add them to staging area. But, the changes are yet to be committed.

3. Before pushing it to the remote repository, which is in web. For that: git commit -m "Text about the commit"
                                                                                      |            
                                                                                      V            
                                                                             m stands for message 
This commit command will fund the changes to local git folder.

4. From here the push command: git push origin main 
                                                 |
                                                 V
                                             Branch Name 


-> This command will update the changes that are tracked and committed to the local git folder to Remote Git Repository in Web.


For Deleting a file and to add that action to remote repository, We need to use the same way git add;

->This command git add filename
                  |
                  V
         This add doesn't means for adding. 
It is the command that say there is something changed and sent.
